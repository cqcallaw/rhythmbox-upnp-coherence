This project is a continuation of the Coherence UPnP plugin for Rhythmbox, based on https://coherence.beebits.net/svn/trunk/Coherence/misc/Rhythmbox-Plugin@1596

It aims to extend and improve the code with compatibility with current Rhythmbox releases, bug fixes, et cetera.

PREREQUISISTES

* Rhythmbox 0.13.3 or greater
* Coherence (tested with Coherence 0.6.6.2)

PRE-INSTALLATION

	1) Close Rhythmbox if it is open.
	2) Move or remove any existing instances of the Coherence UPnP plugin. Instances are typically located in /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/ or /usr/local/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/

INSTALLATION

There are two options for installation: user-level and system-wide. Given the nature of the code, user-level installation is recommended.

To install as a user-level plugin:

	1) Verify the directory ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins exists, and create the directory if it does not exist.
	2) Copy the upnp_coherence directory to ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/

To install as a system-wide plugin:

	1) Copy the upnp_coherence directory to the system-wide plugin folder (/usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/ or /usr/local/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/)

The plugin can be activated from the Rhythmbox plugins configuration window, in the same fashion as other plugins.
