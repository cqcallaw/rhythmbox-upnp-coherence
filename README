This project is a continuation of the Coherence UPnP plugin for Rhythmbox, based on https://coherence.beebits.net/svn/trunk/Coherence/misc/Rhythmbox-Plugin@1596

It aims to extend and improve the code with bug fixes, compatibility with current Rhythmbox releases, etc.

PREREQUISISTES

* Rhythmbox 0.13
* Coherence 0.5.2 or above (tested with Coherence 0.6.6.2)

INSTALLATION

1) Move or remove the existing Coherence UPnP plugin. This is typically located in /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/ or /usr/local/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/
2) Copy the upnp_coherence directory to ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/

The plugin can be activated from the Rhythmbox plugins configuration window, in the same fashion as other plugins.
