This project is a continuation of the Coherence UPnP plugin for Rhythmbox, based on https://coherence.beebits.net/svn/trunk/Coherence/misc/Rhythmbox-Plugin@1596

It aims to extend and improve the code with bug fixes, compatibility with current Rhythmbox releases, etc.

PREREQUISISTES

* Rhythmbox 0.13.3 or greater
* Coherence (tested with Coherence 0.6.6.2)

INSTALLATION

1) Close Rhythmbox if it is open.
2) Move or remove any existing instances of the Coherence UPnP plugin. Instances are typically located in /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/ or /usr/local/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/
3) Copy the upnp_coherence directory to ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/ (for user-level installation) or the system-wide plugin folder (/usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/ or /usr/local/lib/rhythmbox/plugins/)

The plugin can be activated from the Rhythmbox plugins configuration window, in the same fashion as other plugins.
